## Notes

## Challenges encountered while building the app:

- Implementing the fuzzy match logic to allow for slight variations in user answers.

- Ensuring smooth animations for card flips and transitions.

- Managing state for mastered cards, streaks, and incorrect attempts without causing unnecessary re-renders.

- Designing a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future improvements:

- Add user authentication to save progress across sessions.

- Include a dark mode for better accessibility.

- Allow users to create and share their own flashcard decks.

- Add more categories and advanced React concepts.
